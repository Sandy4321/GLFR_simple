This is a simple implemenation of the GLFR benchmark which generates synthetic networks with community structure for testing community detection algorithms.

Network parameters:

-N: number of nodes
-k: average degree of nodes
-kmax: maximum degree of nodes
-smin: minimum size of communities
-smax: maximum size of communities
-gamma: exponent for degree sequence
-beta: exponent for communiy size sequence
-mu: average of the fractions of external links of communities
-delta: maximum distance from the fractions of external links of communities to mu
